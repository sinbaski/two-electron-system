\subsection{LS-coupling and the Land\'e Interval Rule}

In the following section, the $LS$-coupling will be described. An description of its required approximations is presented, and finally the Land\'e Interval Rule is described which in the experiment will be used for investigation of whether $LS$-coupling is valid or not. 

The phenomena of \textit{fine structure} in an atom arises from the coupling of the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron (carried by its spin) and its orbital angular momentum, which gives a contribution $H_{LS}$ to the total Hamiltonian $H_{tot}$ of the system. Due to its spin, an electron has a magnetic dipole moment $\vec{\mu_s}$ that takes the form
\begin{equation}
\vec{\mu_s} = -g_s \frac{\mu_b}{\hbar} \vec{s}
\end{equation}
where $g_s \approx 2$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $\mu_b = e \hbar / 2m_e$ the Bohr magnetron and $\vec{s}$ the spin angular momentum with $|\vec{s}|=\sqrt{s(s+1)} \hbar$ and $\hat{z} \cdot \vec{s} = \hbar m_s$ where $s=1/2$ and $m_s = \pm 1/2$ since the electron is a fermion. If several electrons are involved, the total spin angular momentum $\vec{S}$ will be the vector sum of the individual spin angular momenta, causing the magnetic dipole moment
\begin{equation}
\vec{\mu_S} = -g_s \frac{\mu_b}{\hbar} \vec{S}. 	\label{muS}
\end{equation}
$\vec{S}$ is described by the quantum number $S$ in the same sense that $\vec{s}$ is described by $s$. There are only two allowed directions for the electron spin ("up" or "down"), meaning that $\vec{S}$ is nothing but the sum of up's and down's. Suppose there are $n$ valence electrons bound to the atom (the other electrons form closed shells with no resulting orbital or spin angular momentum). The minimum value $S$ can take is when the spin of as many electrons as possible cancel (all electrons if $n$ is even, and all except one if $n$ is odd). The maximum $S$ occurs when all the spins align. This can be summarized in
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{1-(-1)^{n+1}}{2} , \dots , \frac{n}{2}.
\end{equation}
where the dots indicate integer steps (flipping a spin from $-1/2$ to $+1/2$ results in an integer change of the total spin). For the two electron system ($n=2$) with electron spins $s_1$ and $s_2$, this description is equivalent to the more familiar
\begin{equation}
S = |s_1 - s_2|, \dots, |s_1 + s_2|
\end{equation}
giving $S=0$ or $S=1$. 

An single orbiting charge (with charge $dq$) will classically produce a magnetic field $d\vec{B}$ proportional to the angular momentum $\vec{l}$ of the charge. This can be realized by considering Biot-Savat's law for a moving charge
\begin{equation}
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{dq}{dt} \cdot \frac{d\vec{x} \times \vec{r}}{r^3} \label{BS}
\end{equation}
where $d\vec{x}$ is the infinitesimal length element in the direction of the motion and $\vec{r}$ the position vector of the charge. After some simple algebraic manipulation, eq. (\ref{BS}) is rearranged to
\begin{equation}
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 dq}{4\pi mr^3} \cdot \vec{l} \propto \vec{l}		\label{propL}
\end{equation}
where it has been used that $\vec{l}=m \cdot d\vec{x}/dt \times \vec{r}$ where $m$ is the mass of the charge\footnote{The magnitude of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ due to an orbiting electron in an atom can be estimated by, in eq. (\ref{propL}), letting $d\vec{B}\rightarrow \vec{B}$, $m\rightarrow m_e$, $dq \rightarrow e$, $r \rightarrow r_B$ (Bohr radius) and $|\vec{l}|\rightarrow \hbar$ (of course $|\vec{l}|=\hbar \sqrt{l(l+1)}$ where $l$ is the orbital quantum number, but this is just an estimate of the order of magnitude for the $\vec{B}$-field). This gives $B \approx 12.5$T which is much stronger than most "macroscopic" magnetic fields in our every day life. However, it is quite easily shown that the coulomb attraction between two elementary charges at Bohr radius is about $10^7$ times greater than the magnetic force ($\vec{F}=q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}$) of an electron in an atom put in this field, which justifies the assumption that electron-electron interaction due to their magnetic fields is normally not relevant for $LS$ coupling.}.

By considering an atom from the electrons point of view, the nucleus will orbit the electron, thus creating a magnetic field proportional to the nucleus angular momentum (which only differs by a factor $m_N/m_e$, where $m_N$ is the mass of the nucleus, from the angular momentum of the electron in the nucleus frame of reference). From classical physics, it can be shown that a dipole moment $\vec{\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ tries to align itself with the field, giving a potential energy described by $E=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$. In the electrons frame of reference, different energy levels will therefor arise, depending on the angle between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, and these energy levels must of course still be there when switching back to the more natural frame of reference with the nucleus at the origin. Since the $\vec{B}$-field in the frame of reference of the electron, is proportional to $\vec{l}$ (and therefor also the potential energy contribution $-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$), the energy levels we observe (in the nucleus frame of reference) must also have energies proportional to $\vec{l}$. 

Since $\vec{\mu_s}$ is proportional to $\vec{s}$, the energy contribution for spin-orbit interaction, for an atom with one electron, must be proportional to the product $\vec{l} \cdot \vec{s}$. When spin-orbit coupling in an atom with more than one electron, it is assumed that the energy contribution is proportional to $\vec{L}\cdot\vec{S}$, where $\vec{L}$ is the total orbital angular momentum, described by the quantum number $L$ which is constructed from the $l$'s of the electrons, in the same manner as $S$ is constructed from the $s$'s. The quantum mechanical representation of this is a term $H_{LS}$ in the Hamiltonian of the system, i.e.
\begin{equation}
H_{tot} = H_0 + H_{LS} = H_0 + C \vec{L}\cdot\vec{S}
\end{equation}
where $H_0$ is the Hamilton operator which includes all other energy contributions other than the $LS$-contribution. Here, it is assumed that $-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}\propto\vec{L}\vec{S}$, which is a good approximation in most cases (see [2] for a more detailed discussion).

To deal with the strange operator $\vec{L}\cdot\vec{S}$, the operator $\vec{J}$, defined as
\begin{equation}
\vec{J} \equiv \vec{L} + \vec{S},
\end{equation}
is used to rewrite $\vec{L}\cdot\vec{S}$ to
\begin{equation}
\vec{L}\vec{S}=\frac{1}{2}(\vec{J}^2-\vec{L}^2-\vec{S}^2)
\end{equation}
Since $\vec{J}$, $\vec{L}$ and $\vec{S}$ all are angular momentum operators\footnote{There is no doubt that $\vec{L}$ and $\vec{S}$ are angular momentum operators, but it is not completely obvious that $\vec{J}$ is, given its definition. An angular momentum operator is any operator $\vec{A}=(A_x,A_y,A_z)$ which satisfies the commutator relation $[A_i,A_j]= \epsilon_{ijk} i \hbar A_k$ where $\epsilon_{ijk}=1$ if $ijk$ is a cyclic permutation of $xyz$, $\epsilon_{ijk}=-1$ if $ijk$ is an anti-cyclic permutation and $\epsilon_{ijk}=0$ otherwise. Since $\vec{J} =(J_x,J_y,J_z)=\vec{L} + \vec{S} = (L_x+S_x,L_y+S_y,L_z+S_z)$, and $\vec{L}$ and $\vec{S}$ are angular momentum operators, it holds that $[J_i,J_j]=[L_i+S_i,L_j+S_j]=[L_i,L_k] + [S_i,S_j] + [L_i,S_j] + [S_i,L_j] = \epsilon_{ijk} i \hbar L_k + \epsilon_{ijk} i \hbar S_k  + 0 + 0 = \epsilon_{ijk} i \hbar J_k$, i.e. $\vec{J}$ must be an angular momentum operator. Note that the proof required $[L_i,S_j]=0$ for all $i$ and $j$, which might not have been true if $\vec{L}$ and $\vec{S}$ were some other angular momentum operators, i.e. the sum of two angular momentum operators is not necessarily another angular momentum operator.} that commute with each other, there exists a complete set of eigenstates $\Ket{J,L,S}$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{J}^2 \Ket{J,L,S} = J(J+1) \hbar^2 \Ket{J,L,S},		\label{J}	\\
\vec{L}^2 \Ket{J,L,S} = L(L+1) \hbar^2 \Ket{J,L,S},					\\
\vec{S}^2 \Ket{J,L,S} = S(S+1) \hbar^2 \Ket{J,L,S}.		\label{S}
\end{eqnarray}
Treating the spin-orbit interaction as a perturbation, the energy contribution to an eigenstate $\Ket{J,L,S}$ to first order is
\begin{equation}
E_{LS}^{(1)} = \Bra{J,L,S} C \vec{L}\cdot\vec{S} \Ket{J,L,S} = \frac{C}{2} \Bra{J,L,S} (\vec{J}^2-\vec{L}^2-\vec{S}^2) \Ket{J,L,S}.
\end{equation}
Plugging in eq.(\ref{J})-(\ref{S}), one gets
\begin{equation}
E_{LS}^{(1)}(J,L,S) = \frac{C}{2} (J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)).
\end{equation}
One may now consider the energy difference $\Delta E$ between the two levels $\Ket{J,L,S}$ and $\Ket{J-1,L,S}$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \frac{C}{2} ( J(J+1) - (J-1)J ) = C J,
\end{equation} 
i.e. the energy splitting between two adjacent levels is proportional to the $J$-value of the upper level. This is known as the \textit{Land\'e's interval rule}, and can be a useful test for have how good the $LS$-approximation is. By measuring the energy splitting between different levels with same $L$ and $S$, and divide by $J$, one can investigate how good the $LS$-approximation is for the specific levels. 


\subsection{The Hollow Cathode and the Fourier Transform Spectrometer}

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\label{HC}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\caption{\textit{Simplified picture of the hollow cathode.}}
\end{figure}

Figure 1 shows the tube-shaped hollow cathode, which in this experiment is used to produce the light spectra of Ca I. A sample of Ca I is put inside a tube surrounded by a cathode. In the surroundings, a carrier gas (in this case Ne), is present. When a voltage is put over the tube, electrons will drive towards the anodes at the ends of the tube. Some of these electrons will collide with the Ne atoms and ionize them, provided that the electron had enough energy. The ionized Ne$^+$ will then accelerate towards the cathode in the middle, some of them towards the middle of the cathode where the Ca I sample is placed. The heavy Ne$^+$ atoms will then collide with the Ca sample, causing Ca atoms to leave the sample (this process is called sputtering). The free Ca atoms will thereby, mostly via collisions with electrons, start to radiate (equally in all directions). Some of the radiation will be collected in a lens, before entering the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (shown in figure 2).

\label{FTS}
\begin{center}
\scalebox{.5}{\includegraphics{FTS}}

\caption{\textit{The Fourier Transform Spectrometer.}}
\end{figure}

The Fourier Transform Spectrometer is very similar to the commonly used Michelson interferometer. The incident light is divided into two parts by going through a 45$^\circ$ beam splitter. Each beam is reflected back through the beam splitter, and registered in a detector as shown in figure 2. Depending on the difference between the optical path distances $\Delta l$ for the two beams, they will interfere differently (constructive interference when $\Delta l = m \lambda$ where $m$ is an integer and $\lambda$ the wavelength, and destructive interference when $\Delta l = (m+ 1/2) \lambda$). One of the mirrors can be moved back and forth, making it possible to investigate the interference pattern at different wavelengths. Let $x$ indicate the path distance. By detecting the intensity $I$ as a function of $x$, the different wavenumbers $\sigma$ of spectra is obtained by taking the Fourier transform of $I$:
\begin{equation}
\hat{I}(\sigma ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i\sigma x} I(x) dx,
\end{equation}
giving a peak at each wavenumber of the spectra. Due to Doppler shift of the light, the peaks in the spectra will be approximately Gaussian, i.e. a narrow continuum of light with different wavelengths. Consider the registered intensity around one particular wavenumber $\sigma_i$. When $x=0$, light with any wavenumber will interfere constructively. However, when $x\approx 1/ \sigma_i$, only light with wavenumber close to $\sigma_i$ interfere constructively, which will manifest itself as an intensity decrease (compared to $x=0$). After another period, i.e. $x=2/\sigma_i$, more of the light will cancel, thus giving a lower intensity. When the mirror is moved far enough, the registered intensity will be constant with respect to $x$, meaning that the signal does not contain any information about $\sigma_i$ at all \footnote{One could of course try to show this by calculating the inverse Fourier transform of $\hat{I}(\sigma)$, where $\hat{I}$ is a Gaussian peak in the wavenumber, but this tuns out to be rather messy, and not very instructive for the purpose of this report.} The signal $I(x)$ will therefor be a damped cosine function with wavenumber $\sigma_i$. It turns out ([REFERENS?]) that it is not profitable to move the mirror further than
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{1.2}{2\cdot \delta \sigma}		%I'm not sure about this formula! I just vagely remember it from the Spectrophysics book 										which I don't own.
\end{equation}
where $\delta \sigma$ is the broadening of the line (in terms of wavenumbers).

\section{Experiment \& Results}
In the ground state, $^{20}_{40}Ca$ has the configuration
$[\mathrm{Ar}]4s^2$. In the 1st excited state, one of the 4s electrons is
excited to the 3d state, giving rise to the LS terms $^1D_2$ and
$^3D_{1,2,3}$.

In another excited state, the atom has the configuration 3d4p, and
hence the following LS terms:
\[
\begin{array}{c}
^1P_1, ^3P_{0, 1, 2}\\
^1D_2, ^3D_{1,2,3} \\
^1F_3, ^3F_{2,3,4}
\end{array}
\]

During this experiment, the transitions $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to
3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ and $3d4p\,^3F_{2,3,4} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ are
studied.

\subsection{Transitions $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$}
The anticipated $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions
are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:transition1}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{transition1}
\caption{The $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions}
\label{fig:transition1}
\end{figure}
These transitions have been worked out by following the selection
rules that govern which transitions are possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta L = 0, \pm 1$, but $0 \to 0$ is forbidden;
\item $\Delta J = 0, \pm 1$, but $0 \to 0$ is forbidden;
\item $\Delta S = 0$
\item for individual electrons, $\Delta l = \pm 1$, i.e. the parity
  must change.
\end{itemize}
Under the guidance of the supervisor, the region of the spectrum with
wave number from 17840 $\rm cm^{-1}$ to 17950 $\rm cm^{-1}$ is
searched to find the peaks corresponding to the 7 transitions. The
result is shown in table \ref{tab:transitions1}.

\end{table}
In order to associate the measured peaks with the theoretically
predicted transitions, one has to calculate the theoretical transition
energies and compare them with the experimental results. The
easiest is, however, to calculate and compare the {\it relative}
intensities of the transitions. For that purpose, the intensity of the
transition $3d4p\;^3\mathrm{D}_3 \to 3d4s\;^3\mathrm{D}_3$ is assigned
the value 100, while the intensity of the other lines are represented
as a percentage of it. The calculation is carried out using the
formular
\[
S_{if} = |\matrixel{\psi_i}{e\vec{r}}{\psi_f}|^2
\]
And the result is listed in table \ref{tab:intensity1}
\begin{table}[htb!]

\caption{Theoretically predicted relative intensities of the
  $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions}
\label{tab:intensity1}
\end{table}

Comparing table \ref{tab:intensity1} and table \ref{tab:transitions1},
it is immediately clear that line No.6 corresponds to transition $3
\to 3$, since it has the highest intensity and the $3 \to 3$
transition is predicted to have the highest intensity.

Similarly, one can establish that line No.4 corresponds to $2 \to 2$,
since it has the second highest intensity, and that line No.3
corresponds to $1 \to 1$, since it has the third highest intensity.

The other 4 lines have similar intensities and cannot be discerned in
the same way. The lab manual gives the wave number of the involved
levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item $3d4s\,^3D_1$: 20 335.360
\item $3d4s\,^3D_2$: 20 349.260
\item $3d4s\,^3D_3$: 20 371.000
\end{itemize}
Combining these data with the position of the identified lines No.6,
No.4 and No.3, one can work out the wave number of the other levels as
well as the position of the other lines. Eventually the correspondence
between the lines and the transitions are established. The wave
numbers of the $3d4p ^3D$ terms are shown below, and the
transition-line correspondence is shown in table
\ref{tab:line-transition1}.
\begin{itemize}
\item $3d4p\,^3D_1$: 38192.371
\item $3d4p\,^3D_2$: 38219.099
\item $3d4p\,^3D_3$: 38259.097
\end{itemize}

\caption{\it Experimentally determined relative intensities of the
  $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions. The

\label{tab:exp-intensity1}
\end{table}
Land\'e's interval rule states that, if LS-coupling is valid, the
energy splitting between two LS terms can be calculated as
\[
\Delta E = A J_u
\]
where A is a constant and $J_u$ is the J value of the upper level.

In order to verify or repudiate this statement, the following is
calculated:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\Delta E_{3,2}}{3} &=& \frac{E(3d4p\,^3D_3) -
  E(3d4p\,^3D_2)}{3}\\
&=& \frac{38259.097 - 38219.099}{3} \\
&=& 13.33 \\
\frac{\Delta E_{2,1}}{2} &=& \frac{E(3d4p\,^3D_2) -
  E(3d4p\,^3D_1)}{3}\\
&=& \frac{38219.099 - 38192.371}{2} \\
&=& 13.36
\end{eqnarray*}
$\frac{\Delta E_{3,2}}{3}$ and $\frac{\Delta E_{2,1}}{2}$ are rather
close, thus the validity of Land\'e's interval rule is affirmed.

Another interesting thing observed in table \ref{tab:exp-intensity1}
is that the experimental intensities are generally greater than their
theoretical counterparts. A review of the theoretical treatment
suggests this is an effect of self absortion that has not been
considered so far: Photons emitted during the de-excitation process
have to pass by other atoms in the sample and hence are subject to
scattering and absorption. The cross section of the absorption is
apparently larger for the more intense photons. Therefore, the higher
the intensity, the greater the loss of intensity by self
absorption. As the most intense line is used as a reference of
intensity, the other lines all appear more intense.

\subsection{Transitions $3d4p\,^3F_{2,3,4} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$}
The anticipated $3d4p\,^3F_{2,3,4} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions
are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:transition2}.

As with the $3d4p\,^3D_{1,2,3} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions, the supervisor
helps locate the right region to search for the corresponding peaks. In total, 10 peaks are
found (table \ref{tab:transitions2}):

\label{tab:transitions2}
\end{table}

As has been done for the last group of transitions, the first task is to associate
the transitions with the measured peaks.  Theoretical calculations give the following
for the relative intensity of the peaks: (table \ref{tab:intensity2})
\begin{table}[htb!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|c|}
\cline{3-5}
& & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{$3d4p ^3F$}\\
\cline{3-5}
& & 4 & 3 & 2\\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\multirow{3}{*}{$3d4s ^3D$}} & 3 & 100 & 8.64 & 0.25\\
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & 2 &  & 69.19 & 8.64 \\

\caption{\it Theoretically predicted relative intensities of the
  $3d4p\,^3F_{4,3,2} \to 3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ transitions.}
\label{tab:intensity2}
\end{table}

The strongest three lines are immediately identifiable by their
intensities:
\begin{itemize}
\item $4 \to 3$: No. 10
\item $3 \to 2$: No. 6
\item $2 \to 1$: No. 3
\end{itemize}

Then, as before, one can calculate the wave numbers of the
$3d4p\,^3F_{4,3,2}$ terms using the wave numbers of the
$3d4s\,^3D_{1,2,3}$ terms given in the lab manual.  The reults are
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $3d4p\,^3F_{4}$: 35896.872 $\rm cm^{-1}$.
\item $3d4p\,^3F_{3}$: 35818.691 $\rm cm^{-1}$.
\item $3d4p\,^3F_{2}$: 35730.437 $\rm cm^{-1}$.
\end{itemize}

Then some of the transitions can be associated with the peaks, as shown in table \ref{tab:line-transition2}.
\begin{table}[htb!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline
No. & Transition ($J_1 \to J_2$)\\
\hline
1 & $2 \to 3$ \\
3 & $2 \to 1$ \\
4 & $3 \to 3$ \\
6 & $3 \to 2$\\
10 & $4 \to 3$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Line-transition correspondence}
\label{tab:line-transition2}
\end{table}

As one should have noticed, only 5 of the 6 anticipated lines have
been identified - the $2 \to 2$ line is expected to have wave number
15291.177 $\rm cm^{-1}$ and hence lies outside of the inspected region.
